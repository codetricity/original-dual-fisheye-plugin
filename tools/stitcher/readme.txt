We are including this Android mobile app as part of his plug-in example for educational purposes.
This apk should be installed on your Android mobile phone, not the RICOH THETA.

The input image is the dual-fisheye image from the THETA V produced by his dual-fisheye plug-in.

<Limitations>
1. Input image must be unstitched 5792x2896.
2. Auto leveling doesn't work. Keep camera upright or you can level it manually in this app.
3. App name is not correct (it's named as MiSphere Converter)
4. This app has less functionality than original MiSphere Converter, since it is not forked from the latest version.

<How to use>
1. From your gallery app, send (share) image to "Stitch".
2-a. If you're using exactly the same camera you sent to me, then just copy the attached calib_param.txt in /MiSphereConverter folder. 
2-b. If the camera is different one, click "?" icon and follow the calibration section.
3. Although auto leveling doesn't work, you can manually level it by using 6 buttons at top left.
4. If all set, tap save icon. Then image is stored in /MiSphereConverter.
5. For batch processing, please send multiple images at once.
